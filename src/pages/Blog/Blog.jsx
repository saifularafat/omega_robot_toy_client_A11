                                An access token and a refresh token are both commonly used in
                                authentication and authorization systems to secure and manage access
                                to protected resources, such as APIs or web services.

                                access token is a credential that is issued by an authentication
                                server or authorization server to a client (such as a web
                                application or a mobile app) after the client successfully
                                authenticates itself. It represents the clients authorization to
                                access specific resources or perform certain actions on behalf of
                                the authenticated user.The usually in the Authorization header or as
                                a query parameter. The server validates the access token to
                                determine if the client is authorized to access the requested
                                resource.

                                refresh token is a long-lived credential that is also issued by the
                                authentication server or authorization server alongside the access
                                token. Its purpose is to obtain a new access token when the current
                                access token expires without client (usually in a
                                database or a secure cookie) and is used to request a new access
                                token from the server. This helps improve security by reducing the
                                exposure of the access token since it can have a shorter lifespan.
                                Refresh tokens often have a longer expiration time than access
                                tokens and can be revoked or invalidated by the server if needed.

                                When it comes to working with access tokens and refresh tokens on
                                the client-side, the implementation details can vary depending on
                                the specific authentication framework or technology being used.
                                However, heres a general overview of how they work and where they
                                can be stored

                                The client (such as a web application or mobile app) authenticates
                                with the authentication server by providing valid credentials (e.g.,
                                username and password).Upon successful authentication, the
                                authentication server generates an access token and returns it to
                                the client.The client includes the access token in the requests it
                                sends to the server in order to access protected resources or
                                perform authorized actions.This can be done by checking the token is
                                signature, expiration time, and any associated permissions.

                                </span>
                                Alongside the access token, the authentication server also issues a
                                refresh token to the client during the initial authentication
                                process. The refresh token is typically securely stored on the
                                client-side, such as in a database, secure cookie, or local
                                storage.When the access token expires (as indicated by its
                                expiration time), the client can use the refresh token to request a
                                new access token from the authentication server without requiring
                                the user to reauthenticate. The client replaces the expired
                                access token with the new one and continues making requests to the
                                server.

                                As a web developer, you typically have two options for client-side
                                token storage: localStorage (aka localStorage) and cookies. The two
                                have different purposes, and hence different strengths and
                                weaknesses. Cookies are intended to be read by the server, whereas
                                localStorage can only be read by the browser.

                                SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two
                                types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their

                                organized into rows and columns, and relationships between tables
                                are established through keys (primary and foreign keys). SQL

                                    Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application
                                    framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and straightforward
                                    approach to building web applications and APIs. Express.js allows
                                    developers to handle routes, handle requests and responses, and
                                    manage middleware to add functionality to the application. It has
                                    a rich ecosystem of extensions and middleware modules that can be
                                    easily integrated into an Express.js application. Express.js is
                                    known for its simplicity, scalability, and its ability to quickly
                                    build server-side applications and RESTful APIs.

                                    Nest JS, on the other hand, is a progressive and opinionated
                                    framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable
                                    server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and uses
                                    Express.js under the hood, providing an enhanced development
                                    experience. NestJS follows the architectural principles of
                                    Angular, bringing a similar structure and design patterns to
                                    backend development. It offers a modular and component-based
                                    approach, dependency injection, decorators, and other features
                                    that enable developers to build robust and scalable applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NestJS includes a powerful and extensible dependency injection
                                    system that facilitates building highly testable and loosely
                                    coupled applications. It supports various other modules and
                                    libraries, such as TypeORM and Mongoose for database integration,
                                    WebSocket support, GraphQL, and more. NestJS promotes the use of
                                    decorators and metadata annotations for defining routes,
                                    middleware, and other application components.

                                In summary, while Express.js provides a lightweight and flexible
                                framework for building Node.js applications, NestJS builds upon
                                Express.js and offers an opinionated and feature-rich framework with
                                a focus on modularity, dependency injection, and architectural
                                patterns inspired by Angular. NestJS simplifies backend development
                                and promotes code organization and maintainability.

                                Q.4  What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?

                        </div>

                                In MongoDB, the aggregate method is a powerful feature that allows
                                you to perform advanced data processing and analysis operations on
                                the documents stored in a collection. It provides a way to perform
                                complex transformations, aggregations, and computations within the
                                database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The aggregate method in MongoDB works by taking a pipeline of stages
                                as input. Each stage performs a specific operation on the documents
                                in the collection and passes the results to the next stage in the
                                pipeline. The stages are executed in sequence, allowing you to
                                perform a series of data transformations and aggregations.
                            </p>
                            <p>Here is an overview of how the aggregate method works:</p>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <span className="font-medium">Pipeline Stages: </span>
                                    The aggregate method takes an array of pipeline stages as its
                                    argument. Each stage represents a specific operation that MongoDB
                                    applies to the documents.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <span className="font-medium">Execution Order: </span>
                                    The stages in the pipeline are executed in the order they appear
                                    in the array. The output of each stage serves as the input for the
                                    next stage. This allows for building complex data processing
                                    pipelines.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <span className="font-medium">Result: </span>
                                    After all stages in the pipeline are executed, the aggregate
                                    method returns the final result set, which can include transformed
                                    and aggregated data based on the operations performed in the
                                    pipeline.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <span className="font-medium">Performance Considerations: </span>
                                    The aggregate method can efficiently process large volumes of data
                                    within the database, reducing the need for client-side processing.
                                    It takes advantage of indexes, query optimization, and parallel
                                    execution when applicable.
                                </p>
